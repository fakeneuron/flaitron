# flaitron — PLAN.md

## Vision

A lightweight, versioned, project-agnostic tasknote system for solo
AI-assisted coding. One source of truth, consumed via git submodule by every
project under `~/code/`. Replaces the disjointed per-project workflow files
those projects had each grown on their own.

See [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) for the canonical workflow contract.

## High

(none)

## Medium

(none)

## Low

- [ ] **CORE-864** [light] | release-note-heading-casing — The release that ships CORE-863 must say in its tag notes that `SPEC.md`'s line-1 heading is now lowercase. An `install.sh` from an earlier tag refuses that core (`update` dies "does not hold flaitron"; global ft-adopt is skipped), so users fetch the latest installer. Close with that release.

## Future Opportunities

- [ ] **CORE-866** [moderate] | handoff-row-drift-check — From natabula NAT-535: make SPEC.md §"Deferred hand-off filing" mechanical. Port natabula `scripts/check-handoff-rows.sh` (a hand-off block in an archived note must cite a PLAN row or say none deferred) as a `tools/drift-checks.sh` check or `/ft-task` Phase 4 step. Also have `/ft-close-epic`'s `.N` audit file a row per open hand-off it lists. NAT-495.N listed four and filed none.

## Completed

- [x] **CORE-865** [light]🔧 | agents-md-repo-layout-trim — `AGENTS.md` §"Repo Layout" cut from a file-by-file map to a pointer plus eight must-know bullets (prose outside `## Workflow` 108 → 91, under natabula's 100 budget); `docs/CONTEXT-BUDGET.md` `AGENTS.md` row 10,324 → 8,628. Completed 2026-11-06.
